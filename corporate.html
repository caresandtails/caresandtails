                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #41689f;"></span>
                <strong> #41689F </strong>As our brand is based on dogs, we wanted to appeal to their visibility spectrum, which varies from blue to yellow. Therefore, we wanted blue, which is one of the main colors they see, to be one of the main colors of our brand.</li>
                <li class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification">
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1 bodyfont" style="background-color: #FFF9EB;"></span>
                <strong> #FFF9EB </strong> Our brand looks to showcase a clean, comfortable look. Due to this we wanted to have a soft color that would embody our vision. We choose a biege color to contrast our blue, making a fun combination between them.</li>
				<li class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification">
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1 bodyfont" style="background-color: #Bf9aca;"></span>
                <strong> #BF9ACA</strong> With our two main colors being blue and biege, we wanted to add a speck of color in our brand and website. We chose purple for this as it represents creativity and femininity, which are two of the direct traits from the creators.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2 class="titlesfont bluefont">Font choices</h2>
		 	<p class="titlesfont bluefont sizeadjustment"> Amatic SC</p>
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification"> We chose this font because we wanted to give a sense of friendliness and coziness. We saw the font and felt the font transmited a feeling of warmness and home that we thought really stuck with our brand and what we wanted to convey.The font was also simple and easy to read while still looking as if it was handwritten, which we thought was a nice touch.</p>
			
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont sizeadjustment"> Roboto </p>
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification"> We chose this font because of its simplicity. As this font is from the same family as San-Serif it is both easy to read and comprehend on screens by people. Due to its neutral and minimalistic, yet classy, look it reaches everyone, making it easy to read even for people with low vision and dislexia. We wanted our website to be accessible, inclusive, and easy to use. </p>
			
		  <h2 class="titlesfont bluefont"> Website justifications</h2>
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"> <strong> General Aspects:</strong> For the general aspects of our website, we decided to maintain a few elements all throughout our website. For example, every added element has rounded borders to maintain a consistent look throughout the whole website. We also stuck with both our main colors, blue and beige to make contrast between them, and our two fonts all throughout. We mixed the typography and color and made them our chosen colors in every text area, so it always looked the same. We also added our purple color to every button once the user hovers, to add color to the site and make it clear for the users when they are really clicking or on something. Our website is also fully responsive across different devices, adapting to any screen size our users may have.</p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"> Both our header and footer are maintained without alteration across the whole website.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"> <strong>Header:</strong> The header contains the second version of our logo, which is a simple and minimalized version made with the purpose of making it easy to see and recognize on a website screen. We placed the logo on the left side so that it would stand out from the other section titles and interactive so that when it is clicked, it takes the user back to the home page, no matter in what section of the website the user is. The other titles in the header to the right, will redirect the user correspondingly to the section they clicked on. When the user is accessing a certain section, it will turn purple informing them on which page they are currently on and differentiating it from the other titles.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Footer:</strong> In the footer, we decided that it was important for our users to have a quick way to find us on social media; therefore, we added icons of the logos of both Instagram and Facebook. Once clicked, the hyperlink associated with each icon redirects the users to our social media accounts, making things simple and fast for them, enhancing their user experience with our website. We also added a small text at the bottom left corner that includes the name of our brand, Cares &amp; Tails, and its creation year, as we have seen on many other websites, to give a professional look. </p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Home Page:</strong> For the “Home” page, we wanted to keep it simple so it would not distract the users from the main service of our website. We first chose to add a blurred picture inside a container as the background so that it would not distract the users from the informational text. We chose a dog picture that we believe aligns with our vision and brand, as the dog shows the loneliness that we are trying to erase. Moreover, we decided to add a button to direct users to our main service without the need to move around the website or get lost, making it interactive and user-friendly. Likewise, with our text, we wanted to explain in a short yet attractive way the purpose of our website and how they can book our service. We also wanted to make sure to update them about our upcoming feature, so they could get all the information on one page. 
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>About us page:</strong> We start the “About us” page with a container, that includes “Who is Cares &amp; Tails” as a brand and “Why Cares &amp; Tails” where we expose our vision. These two texts are written horizontally beside each other. This makes it easier for the user to read and focus on each topic one at a time, while giving a clean and organized look to the website. We also decided to make the container blue to avoid it merging with the header. Moreover, with blue being our main color, it shows contrast with the beige below and above, making each section catch the user's eye. Under this, we showcase our main values as a small list making a uniform and aligned structure that stands out. Consequently, in the “Meet the Team” section we made use of display cards, to showcase our members in an organized and clean way. Here we implemented round photos, following our rounded border's theme, and a small text that introduces to the user the faces behind the brand. Finally, at the bottom of the page the user encounters a “Contact us” form. We decided to add it at the end so visitors can easily find a way to reach out to us if they have questions or concerns after reading all the content above.  
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Services page:</strong> In the “Services” page, we placed a “Book with Us” booking container right at the beginning of our page strategically positioned for quick access to booking a dogsitter. The page background is set to our blue making contrast with the containers that have our beige, highlighting the key parts. For an easier process and to provide a more user-friendly and effective experience, we made sure to create specific boxes that made the booking process as easy as possible. We included boxes for things such as the user's area, number of dogs, and a calendar to place the start and end date of their booking. In addition, under this we can find the best rated sitters' section which we divided into four rows for easy user navigation. These rows adapt and respond to small screens showing the sitters in one single row when scrolling. Within each card element we can first find a picture of each dog-sitter to give users a visual impression. Beneath the image, the user will find a concise description of the sitter's experience, their reviews, response time, and their price range, along with a “Learn More” button. The button is blue but when hovered turns purple following our standard theme and offering an intuitive indication for users to interact with the button.  	
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Forum page:</strong> The “Forum” page is not the final version due to the complexity that is required to make an actual forum page like we had ideated, as this would be an area for users to interact with each other, discuss, help, and answer any questions. To help our website still create anticipation, we added a countdown timer indicating when the forum page would be launched to the public. Besides that, blue was used again in the background, and we decided to include our second logo, which is the face of our social media, to give a visual representation of the forum's aesthetics. Aside from this, we also included a brief description of what the forum page would consist of to give some insight to the users on what they can expect in terms of the upcoming content.

      <h4 class="titlesfont smalltitlescorporate pb-3"> Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>	
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> 
		    Cares &amp; Tails is a brand focused on providing a helping hand for dog owners who face the problem of not having where to leave their dog when they are away for work, vacations or are just generally busy. The brand's message is to ease the worries dog owners may face and help them feel like they found a place they trust for their pet friends. For our promotional campaign and our brand, we decided to focus on two target audiences. Our brand is targeted at two sub-groups which are described below. We decided to go with two target groups because we thought this problem is a common thing that different people experience. Not all dog owners have the same characteristics, such as living situation, income, age, etc. and therefore we chose two of the possible target groups that we believe experience this problem more recurrently than others.</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> <strong>Sub target group 1: Families</strong></p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Age: 30-44</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Personality: family driven, traveling, social, outdoor liker, both parents work</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- People with younger kids  
        
        - Europe&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"><strong>&nbsp;Sub target group 2: People living alone&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Age: 25-44</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Personality: afraid of loneliness, safety, seeks comfort, work addicts, friendly, stay-at-home person.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Heavy workers (long office hours, work trips)</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Europe </p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> 
	  By having those two groups we decided to go for two social media platforms in which to promote and execute our campaign. We decided to go for the platforms that were mentioned in our interviews and in our research, where we saw that the most used by our target groups according to statistics are Instagram and Facebook. Research showed that 51.1% of Facebook users and 46.6% of Instagram users are aged between 25 and 44. Thanks to these percentages we decided to focus on both social media for a bigger reach to our audience. </p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> 
		  We chose Instagram with its innovative visual features, allowing our company to show different sides with diverse types of content like reels and photo posts in an engaging way. We then chose Facebook, as it is a much more family-oriented and social platform, with its broad user base and groups features it allowed our brand to engage directly with families, sharing valuable content and creating a feeling of community. On our objectives, we expected a higher number of followers on Instagram as we have personally seen that even bigger brands don’t get as many interactions or followers on Facebook as they do on Instagram, therefore lowering our objective expectations with this platform.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">
		  For our actual campaign post we planned on first posting content related to our brand, posting our logo, explaining the colors, our vision and mission. Besides this, we also wanted to make some informational posts about dogs in general such as tips and fun facts about dogs to interact more with our audiences, as well as using appealing captions with emojis and fun word play. Aside from our informatically and more “serious” posts, we also tried a comedic approach on video format to really get our targeted groups to relate with our posts and have a good time while scrolling through our page. All of these things contributed to our campaign and to our audiences getting to know better who Cares &amp; Tails is, what we do, get information about dog-related topics, all while at the same time getting entertained.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">
  	  Furthermore, our objective was to reach at least 75 Instagram followers and 15 Facebook followers by April 5, 2024.  We wanted the dog owners in our audience to have faith in our company to look after their pets, ensuring the dogs receive companionship while their owners are away. It was critical that our target audience stays involved with our brand's progress and social media presence. Thus, we strived for tangible engagements, such as receiving at least 5 likes on each post from our followers. </p>
    <h4 class="titlesfont smalltitlescorporate pb-3"> Learning Points </h4>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">
		<strong> General point:</strong> For our posts we decided to constantly change and try many different aspects every week to really see what worked and what didn’t and later on reflect on that. Because of this, we would analyze how our week went and change things for the next, that way we really saw what was effective. Once we saw things worked, we would put it to the real test and try it for 2 weeks and so on.</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> <strong> Instagram:</strong></p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"><strong>Week 1 of Posting (26/02 - 03/03)</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">
      <strong>What we did:</strong> We made our first introductory post at 16:00h on Sunday, after seeing the Instagram analytics of one of the members of the group. We saw there was a high number of users active at this time and decided to try it out for our first post as we did not have any sources at the moment. We also decided to share our Instagram account (@caresandtails) with friends. In our post we implemented random hashtags we thought related to our brand that we came up in the moment.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What worked:</strong> After posting we got a total of:</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 20 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 21 accounts</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Engaged with 8 accounts coming from our followers.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">
      <strong> What we changed:</strong> After this week, we changed our bio to gain more engagement and give the public more knowledge of our brand. We also researched in both Chat GPT and Google the best hashtags for both Instagram and Facebook for dog businesses to implement them in our posts. In addition, we decided to add #explorepage to increase our audience reach and more posting days after online research. We also saw that posting too much, meaning various times in one day, could actually affect negatively the growth of an account. Because of this we decided to stick to 3 posts per week, leaving one break day in between. We also checked what times worked best and agreed on trying new content formats, as well as to start reposting our posts on our stories. </p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Week 2 of Posting (04/03 - 10/03)</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">
      <strong> What we did:</strong> This week, we decided to try things out and post on Wednesday at 18:00h, Friday at 13:00, to attempt an earlier time after more research, and on Sunday at 14:00h, making it now two hours earlier than last time. We agreed that for these posts we were going to place the new hashtags we had found, try a new time for each day and new humorous video formats to see if there was an increase in the reach and engagement. We also decided to start reposting all our posts and reels on our stories to see if we would reach our followers more, as users tend to interact and see stories more than their feed. Furthermore, because of this we also decided to promote our Facebook on our Instagram to see if we could bring our followers from  one platform to the other. </p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong> What worked: </strong>At the end of the week, we reached a total of:&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 42 accounts with our account in general</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">-14 from non-followers (increase of 16,6%)&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Engaged with 16 accounts total, 1 being a non-follower&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Our post on the 06/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 19 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 56 accounts, 19 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Our second post on the 08/03 received:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 19 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 47 accounts, 14 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Our video from the 10/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 113 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 13 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached by 47 accounts, 12 being non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">Compared to the previous week there was a general increase in all parameters which makes us believe that our implementations from the previous week generally worked.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What we changed: </strong>After seeing how the week went, we decided to change the posting times again after another research to see if we could achieve a higher increase in our engagement. We added new hashtags, decided to implement the use of AI in our caption making, and modified our post layout. </p>
<p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Week 3 of Posting (11/03 - 17/03)</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"> <strong>What we did:</strong> This week, we decided to change the posting time throughout our posts, now making it at 11:00 rather than at 18:00h on Wednesday, 14:00 rather than 13:00 on Friday and at 18:00h on Sunday rather than at 14:00h. We agreed to switch to these times after conducting more research to see if there would be an increase in our engagement. We also decided to add more relevant hashtags to each post to see if the reach expanded after finding the best hashtags to use in posts. On our post on the 17th, we made the decision to try posting only one post rather than multiple (collections) to see if people would engage more with it, as they don’t need to scroll the get the information. We also made use of Chat GPT for our captions but changed its wording to make it more natural and for it to fit our style.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What worked:</strong> This week we got a total reach of:</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 178 accounts</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 139 non-followers (increase of 892%)</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Total engagement of 21 accounts, 2 non-followers (increase of 100%)</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Our post from the 13/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 18 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1 comment</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 39 accounts reached, 7 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>The reel from the 15/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 15 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 2 comments</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 241 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 169 accounts, 135 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>The post of the 17/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 12 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 38 accounts, 8 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"> When we compare our results to previous weeks, we can see that the videos reach the most accounts rather than the regular posts, which leads us to believe that introducing videos to our weekly posts is working and giving our account more reach.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">
	  <strong>What we changed:</strong> After the change in the posting schedule of last week we saw an increase in the reach of the accounts and posts, so we decided to try one more week with the same posting time to see if our reach keeps increasing. We also agreed to add the category “pet sitter” to our account to see if we reached more accounts and decided to focus more on videos formats for our weekly posts.</p>
<p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Week 4 of Posting (18/03 - 24/03)</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What we did:</strong> For this week, the posting schedule was kept the same as the previous week. Here we decided to publish “reel - post - reel” as opposed to the other weeks where it was only one reel and the rest regular posts.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What worked:</strong> This week we got a total reach of:</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 584 accounts</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 544 non-followers (increase of 291%)</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Total engagement of 33 accounts, 17 non-followers (increase of 750%)</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>On our video post on the 20/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">-21 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 404 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 321 accounts reached 285 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Our post on the 22/03 got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 14 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 33 accounts reached 4 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>On the 24/03 our video got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 76 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1,212 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1,085 accounts reached, 1,054 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">After seeing our results, we clearly understood how the posting of more reels increased greatly our reach by 366 accounts. We can see that the times we are posting are working well as our videos and profile get a high number of views.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"> <strong>What we changed:</strong> Due to the lack of time left for the finalization of the project and our total number of posts being less than 15, we were suggested to increase the number of weekly posts to reach a total of at least 20 posts. To accomplish this, we decided to increase the number of posts going from 3 posts a week to multiple posts per day. For this, we also had to introduce new time schedules for our new posting days. These changes were made to be able to do more research, analyze our progress, and further understand what works and what doesn't, as this is a learning process.  
	    As this decision came later in the day, we had to change our posting time on Thursday to a random time, as our usual time had already passed. This also helps us to see what the reaction is in terms of interactions when posting at random times rather than a strict schedule. Following our other results, we decided to post even more reels in the week rather than focusing on normal posts. This was to see if we get more overall interactions after seeing that most interactions come from reels rather than posts and to see the effects of multiple posts on one day. We also agreed to test the reaction of posting a video with a random visual that didn’t deal with dogs and try to add a song to one of our normal posts after seeing that it was commonly used by other creators.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Week 5 of Posting (25/03 - 31/03)</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What we did:</strong> This week we posted on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday for the first time, and Sunday. We also decided to post on Friday 29, two reels rather than “post and reel”, to see how it could affect the reach of both videos and if it affected its views. We also agreed to post on Sunday late at night (1:00am) and post a video that did not include dogs but rather was a topic far different from what we are used to posting. That day we also tried and posted our image with a song to see if there were any extra interactions.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What worked:</strong> This week we got a total reach of:</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 4,505 accounts</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 4,443 non-followers (increase of 716%)</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Total engagement of 407 accounts, 386 non-followers (increase of 2,170%)</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>On Wednesday 27/03 we got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 9 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 22 accounts, 1 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>On Thursday 28/03, our video got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 85 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 801 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 710 accounts, 685 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>On Friday 29/03, our first video got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 68 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1355 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 2 saves</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reached 1,011 accounts, 985 non-followers</p>

	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 118 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1486 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1 save</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Reach of 1,164, of which 1,140 were non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Lastly, on Sunday 31/03 our video got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 10 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 201 views</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1 save</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 155 accounts reached, 133 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Our post of Sunday got:</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 12 likes</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1 comment</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 26 accounts reached, 4 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">After this trial week of multiple posts, we got a huge increase of 3,921 accounts. This confirmed our belief that videos bring the most engagement, reach, and are the preferred content of our target audience. We can see how the videos do best as they also appear on the feed of non-followers, giving the reels a bigger audience. We also discovered that posting two reels in one day does not affect its success or engagement.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What we changed:</strong> As mentioned before, these last weeks are focused on trying new things. For the next week, we are trying out a collaboration post with another account.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>Week 6 of Posting (01/04 - 07/04)</strong></p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What we did:</strong> For this week, we posted our last 4 posts, 1 on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, and lastly 1 post on Wednesday. We stuck to our past strategies as we saw they worked effectively, we did add a collaboration post with another account to see if we could help each other and expose our content to a bigger and different audience. We collaborated with famvan.nl and posted it on Tuesday followed by a reel. This week we focused only on reels aside from the collaborative post.</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification"><strong>What worked:</strong> For this short week, we got a total reach of:</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1,033 accounts</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- 1,000 non-followers</p>
	  <p class="beigefont textjustification">- Total engagement of 79 accounts, 69 non-followers</p>
