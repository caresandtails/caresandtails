                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #41689f;"></span>
                <strong> #41689F </strong>As our brand is based on dogs, we wanted to appeal to their visibility spectrum, which varies from blue to yellow. Therefore, we wanted blue, which is one of the main colors they see, to be one of the main colors of our brand.</li>
                <li class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification">
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1 bodyfont" style="background-color: #FFF9EB;"></span>
                <strong> #FFF9EB </strong> Our brand looks to showcase a clean, comfortable look. Due to this we wanted to have a soft color that would embody our vision. We choose a biege color to contrast our blue, making a fun combination between them.</li>
				<li class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification">
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1 bodyfont" style="background-color: #Bf9aca;"></span>
                <strong> #BF9ACA</strong> With our two main colors being blue and biege, we wanted to add a speck of color in our brand and website. We chose purple for this as it represents creativity and femininity, which are two of the direct traits from the creators.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2 class="titlesfont bluefont">Font choices</h2>
		 	<p class="titlesfont bluefont sizeadjustment"> Amatic SC</p>
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification"> We chose this font because we wanted to give a sense of friendliness and coziness. We saw the font and felt the font transmited a feeling of warmness and home that we thought really stuck with our brand and what we wanted to convey.The font was also simple and easy to read while still looking as if it was handwritten, which we thought was a nice touch.</p>
			
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont sizeadjustment"> Roboto </p>
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification"> We chose this font because of its simplicity. As this font is from the same family as San-Serif it is both easy to read and comprehend on screens by people. Due to its neutral and minimalistic, yet classy, look it reaches everyone, making it easy to read even for people with low vision and dislexia. We wanted our website to be accessible, inclusive, and easy to use. </p>
			
		  <h2 class="titlesfont bluefont"> Website justifications</h2>
			<p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"> <strong> General Aspects:</strong> For the general aspects of our website, we decided to maintain a few elements all throughout our website. For example, every added element has rounded borders to maintain a consistent look throughout the whole website. We also stuck with both our main colors, blue and beige to make contrast between them, and our two fonts all throughout. We mixed the typography and color and made them our chosen colors in every text area, so it always looked the same. We also added our purple color to every button once the user hovers, to add color to the site and make it clear for the users when they are really clicking or on something. Our website is also fully responsive across different devices, adapting to any screen size our users may have.</p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"> Both our header and footer are maintained without alteration across the whole website.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"> <strong>Header:</strong> The header contains the second version of our logo, which is a simple and minimalized version made with the purpose of making it easy to see and recognize on a website screen. We placed the logo on the left side so that it would stand out from the other section titles and interactive so that when it is clicked, it takes the user back to the home page, no matter in what section of the website the user is. The other titles in the header to the right, will redirect the user correspondingly to the section they clicked on. When the user is accessing a certain section, it will turn purple informing them on which page they are currently on and differentiating it from the other titles.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Footer:</strong> In the footer, we decided that it was important for our users to have a quick way to find us on social media; therefore, we added icons of the logos of both Instagram and Facebook. Once clicked, the hyperlink associated with each icon redirects the users to our social media accounts, making things simple and fast for them, enhancing their user experience with our website. We also added a small text at the bottom left corner that includes the name of our brand, Cares &amp; Tails, and its creation year, as we have seen on many other websites, to give a professional look. </p>
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Home Page:</strong> For the “Home” page, we wanted to keep it simple so it would not distract the users from the main service of our website. We first chose to add a blurred picture inside a container as the background so that it would not distract the users from the informational text. We chose a dog picture that we believe aligns with our vision and brand, as the dog shows the loneliness that we are trying to erase. Moreover, we decided to add a button to direct users to our main service without the need to move around the website or get lost, making it interactive and user-friendly. Likewise, with our text, we wanted to explain in a short yet attractive way the purpose of our website and how they can book our service. We also wanted to make sure to update them about our upcoming feature, so they could get all the information on one page. 
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>About us page:</strong> We start the “About us” page with a container, that includes “Who is Cares &amp; Tails” as a brand and “Why Cares &amp; Tails” where we expose our vision. These two texts are written horizontally beside each other. This makes it easier for the user to read and focus on each topic one at a time, while giving a clean and organized look to the website. We also decided to make the container blue to avoid it merging with the header. Moreover, with blue being our main color, it shows contrast with the beige below and above, making each section catch the user's eye. Under this, we showcase our main values as a small list making a uniform and aligned structure that stands out. Consequently, in the “Meet the Team” section we made use of display cards, to showcase our members in an organized and clean way. Here we implemented round photos, following our rounded border's theme, and a small text that introduces to the user the faces behind the brand. Finally, at the bottom of the page the user encounters a “Contact us” form. We decided to add it at the end so visitors can easily find a way to reach out to us if they have questions or concerns after reading all the content above.  
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Services page:</strong> In the “Services” page, we placed a “Book with Us” booking container right at the beginning of our page strategically positioned for quick access to booking a dogsitter. The page background is set to our blue making contrast with the containers that have our beige, highlighting the key parts. For an easier process and to provide a more user-friendly and effective experience, we made sure to create specific boxes that made the booking process as easy as possible. We included boxes for things such as the user's area, number of dogs, and a calendar to place the start and end date of their booking. In addition, under this we can find the best rated sitters' section which we divided into four rows for easy user navigation. These rows adapt and respond to small screens showing the sitters in one single row when scrolling. Within each card element we can first find a picture of each dog-sitter to give users a visual impression. Beneath the image, the user will find a concise description of the sitter's experience, their reviews, response time, and their price range, along with a “Learn More” button. The button is blue but when hovered turns purple following our standard theme and offering an intuitive indication for users to interact with the button.  	
		  <p class="bodyfont bluefont textjustification pt-2"><strong>Forum page:</strong> The “Forum” page is not the final version due to the complexity that is required to make an actual forum page like we had ideated, as this would be an area for users to interact with each other, discuss, help, and answer any questions. To help our website still create anticipation, we added a countdown timer indicating when the forum page would be launched to the public. Besides that, blue was used again in the background, and we decided to include our second logo, which is the face of our social media, to give a visual representation of the forum's aesthetics. Aside from this, we also included a brief description of what the forum page would consist of to give some insight to the users on what they can expect in terms of the upcoming content.

      <h4 class="titlesfont smalltitlescorporate pb-3"> Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>	
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> 
		    Cares &amp; Tails is a brand focused on providing a helping hand for dog owners who face the problem of not having where to leave their dog when they are away for work, vacations or are just generally busy. The brand's message is to ease the worries dog owners may face and help them feel like they found a place they trust for their pet friends. For our promotional campaign and our brand, we decided to focus on two target audiences. Our brand is targeted at two sub-groups which are described below. We decided to go with two target groups because we thought this problem is a common thing that different people experience. Not all dog owners have the same characteristics, such as living situation, income, age, etc. and therefore we chose two of the possible target groups that we believe experience this problem more recurrently than others.</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> <strong> Sub target group 1: Families</strong></p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Age: 30-44</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Personality: family driven, traveling, social, outdoor liker, both parents work</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- People with younger kids  
        
        - Europe&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"><strong>&nbsp;Sub target group 2: People living alone&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Age: 25-44</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Personality: afraid of loneliness, safety, seeks comfort, work addicts, friendly, stay-at-home person.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Heavy workers (long office hours, work trips)</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">&nbsp;- Europe </p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> By having those two groups we decided to go for two social media platforms in which to promote and execute our campaign. We decided to go for the platforms that were mentioned in our interviews and in our research, where we saw that the most used by our target groups according to statistics are Instagram and Facebook. Research showed that 51.1% of Facebook users and 46.6% of Instagram users are aged between 25 and 44. Thanks to these percentages we decided to focus on both social media for a bigger reach to our audience. </p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification"> We chose Instagram with its innovative visual features, allowing our company to show different sides with diverse types of content like reels and photo posts in an engaging way. We then chose Facebook, as it is a much more family-oriented and social platform, with its broad user base and groups features it allowed our brand to engage directly with families, sharing valuable content and creating a feeling of community. On our objectives, we expected a higher number of followers on Instagram as we have personally seen that even bigger brands don’t get as many interactions or followers on Facebook as they do on Instagram, therefore lowering our objective expectations with this platform.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">For our actual campaign post we planned on first posting content related to our brand, posting our logo, explaining the colors, our vision and mission. Besides this, we also wanted to make some informational posts about dogs in general such as tips and fun facts about dogs to interact more with our audiences, as well as using appealing captions with emojis and fun word play. Aside from our informatically and more “serious” posts, we also tried a comedic approach on video format to really get our targeted groups to relate with our posts and have a good time while scrolling through our page. All of these things contributed to our campaign and to our audiences getting to know better who Cares &amp; Tails is, what we do, get information about dog-related topics, all while at the same time getting entertained.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class="bodyfont beigefont textjustification">Furthermore, our objective was to reach at least 75 Instagram followers and 15 Facebook followers by April 5, 2024.  We wanted the dog owners in our audience to have faith in our company to look after their pets, ensuring the dogs receive companionship while their owners are away. It was critical that our target audience stays involved with our brand's progress and social media presence. Thus, we strived for tangible engagements, such as receiving at least 5 likes on each post from our followers. </p>
