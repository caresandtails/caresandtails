		<p class="bodyfont">&nbsp;They live in a house with a backyard, with their 2 kids and husband Paul Lopez, they have been together since 2009.  
		  
		They enjoy spending time outside with their kids and their dog Valentin (a 3-year-old Golden Retriever).  
		  
		During the day she works as a math university teacher and Paul works as an 	accountant, from 9 to 17. Their kids are 7 and 10 so they spend their days in school. During this time Valentin is alone at home, which is a hassle for the family.  
		  
		Anna and Paul try to make some time for themselves, so they go out with their friends once per week.   
		  
		Anna and her husband have an above average income, so she takes her family on vacation outside the country on holidays, having the trouble to leave Valentin behind.  
		  
		Anna and Paul live abroad from their families, so they usually can’t rely on them to take care of their dog. </p>
			
		<p class="bodyfont"> <strong> Daniel di Angelo -&nbsp; </strong> 26 years old&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="bodyfont">	
		He lives alone in an apartment in the center of the city  

		He works in finance in an office, from 8 to 17. He has an average income. 

		He owns a small dog named Tofu (an 8-month-old white Pomeranian)  

		He got Tofu when he moved to the capital for his new job, to have some company and comfort in his journey. He is from a small village in the outsides of the city. 

		He is often busy with work but when he is free, he spends time at home with Tofu. He takes him on walks at night and before work. Daniel feels guilty about not being able to spend time with him and having to leave him alone due to work.  

		On holidays he brings Tofu with him, but he must leave him at home when he goes on work trips, which is often.
